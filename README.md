# Le BoN Nobel
This is our awesome project for the course DH2321 Information Visualization 2017 at KTH.

## Get started
* Clone the repository to your computer using the [terminal](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or using [SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/clone-a-repository-into-sourcetree-780870050.html#ClonearepositoryintoSourceTree-Method#1-DirectlythroughtheSourceTree'sMainUI) (we have a **git** repository)
* To run our project locally you need to set up a local server. 
  * You can do this either by downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) or a similar program. 
  * Or you can use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
    * Install Node and open the terminal, go to where you cloned the repository
    * Write "npm install"
    * Write "npm start" -> Server is up and running!


## Workflow

### Branches
We will try to work in git [branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches). 
> "This makes sure that unstable code is never committed to the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your featureâ€™s history before merging it into the main branch."

When you are about to make changes, create a new branch and work in the branch until you are finished. When you are finished, you can go to github.com and create a pull request and you will see if it's possible to merge your branch with master branch.

### Coding guidelines
Keep the code nice and clean so it's easier for the other people in the group to change if necessary.
* Comment what you do!
* Remove things you don't use!
* Use clear variable names!

### Model-view-controller
Since we are using [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/api), we are working with the [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). Our model is called service. 
> * The model is the central component of the pattern. It expresses the application's behavior in terms of the problem domain, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
> * A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
> * The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
