# Le BoN Nobel
This is our awesome project for the course DH2321 Information Visualization 2017 at KTH.

## Get started
* Clone the repository to your computer using the [terminal](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or using [SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/clone-a-repository-into-sourcetree-780870050.html#ClonearepositoryintoSourceTree-Method#1-DirectlythroughtheSourceTree'sMainUI) (we have a **git** repository)
* To run our project locally you need to set up a local server. You can do this easily by downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) or a similar program. 


## Workflow
We will try to work in git [branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches). 
> "This makes sure that unstable code is never committed to the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your featureâ€™s history before merging it into the main branch."
